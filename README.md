<h2>Information About Our Visualizations</h2>

<h3>Mean User Ratings for Painting Styles Over Time</h3>
<p>This visualization shows how user scores changed as styles evolved over time. This was achieved by aggregating the data by year and style and then taking the average of the Mean rating at each point to find the Mean rating for a given style at a point in time. Each style is represented by a different color, and styles can be filtered out by clicking on them on the legend. Viewers can also zoom in/out of the data by scrolling up/down respectively and the visualization will zoom in to the point that the user's mouse is pointing at. Alternatively, users can click and drag to draw a box around the area that they would like to zoom in to.</p>
